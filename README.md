# DEPRECATED - Figma launched their own desktop app.

The old readme continues below for posterity. *Thank you* Figma team for releasing an official desktop client! :)

# Figma for Mac (unofficial)

This is an [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron) wrapper for [Figma](https://figma.com). It lets you install Figma on your Mac and easily access it from the Dock instead of your web browser.

## Caveats

I'm not really a Node developer, so this is just a basic implementation. There are some known (and some unknown!) issues with this project:

- Pinch to zoom does not work. I imagine this is solvable, but I don't know how.
- This is a third-party project not associated with Figma, Inc., so use it at your own risk.

## How to Install

1. Download the latest [Release](https://github.com/wr/figma-mac/releases/) from GitHub, unzip, and drag to your Applications folder.

2. Launch the app.

3. Log in with your Figma credentials.

4. Party hardy.

## I need help!

This project is far from finished. I created it because I prefer desktop apps over webapps, and I wanted to give Figma a try. So far, I think it shows tons of promise.

If you have experience with Node and / or Electron, and would like to help make this app cleaner, leaner, faster, and more reliable with me, please submit a PR or email me at wells.riley@me.com with "Figma for Mac" somewhere in the subject line. Should be pretty fun!

## Troubleshooting

¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Figma is still in beta, and so is this Mac app. Stuff will probably break. Feel free to [submit a GitHub issue](https://github.com/wr/figma-mac/issues) or [contact the official Figma support line](https://www.figma.com/contact) if you need help.

## Building it yourself

1. Download [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron) via NPM (`electron-prebuilt`)
2. `cd` to this repo on your Mac, make whatever changes you like, and run `electron .` to run a live preview of your Figma app.
3. To package the app as a binary, download [electron-packager](https://github.com/maxogden/electron-packager) and run it from the directory above the repo:
```
electron-packager figma-mac Figma --platform=darwin --arch=x64 --version=0.35.2 --app-version=[your-version] --icon='figma-mac/extras/atom.icns' --overwrite
```
